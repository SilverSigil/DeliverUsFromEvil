# DeliverUsFromEvil
LD53 - Deliver Us:From Evil
A terrible human being dies in a comedically tragic way and is sent straight to hell. 

In demon court, they’re given a terrible and terrifying punishment for their sins - to become a gnarly demon and perform dastardly menial tasks for no pay - aka, the equivalent of human Fiverr or Task Rabbit. 

The human-turned-demon is sent back to the mortal plane and works for Evil Corp as a task demon, fulfilling various wacky, mean, supernatural, unexpected, and fun tasks for the app’s clientele.
